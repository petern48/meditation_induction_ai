        "You should understand the basics of PyTorch and how a training loop works before getting started. [This official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) serves as an excellent introduction. Familiarity with the workings of GPT2 might be useful but isn't required. The code has been written for clarity and not re-use. I'd advise refactoring it for actual projects. I've liberally taken bits from [Chris McCormick's BERT fine-tuning tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/), [Ian Porter's GPT2 tutorial](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html) and the [Hugging Face Language model fine-tuning script](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.0.0/examples.html#language-model-fine-tuning) so full credit to them. Chris' code has pretty much provided the basis for this script - you should definitely check out his [blog](https://mccormickml.com/tutorials/).\n",

        "- [Freezing layers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/1431). This is the process of only changing the parameters in selected layers, made famous by the [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) process.\n",

        "- [Tensor packing](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html). This is a neat way of fitting in as much training data in each batch.\n",
        "- [Hyperparameter search](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/using-hyperparameter-search-in-trainer/785/10). I settled quickly on values that seemed to produce decent values, without checking if they were optimal."

On one such journey it is said, 'The way to live is to travel by way of life.' On another journey by way of death it is said, 'The way to live is to die.' 'How shall we go to death? By way of life.'

This is a short mindfulness practice that we hope you can incorporate into your routine and then go within when it feels right to you rather than rushing or forcing or just simply finding a comfortable position and we'll begin with an alternate nostril breathing practice so the instructions are in the description and then we'll open the practice by simply taking a inhale through your nose and then a exhale through your mouth. Begin to drop down into relaxation and then gently introduce our mantra for the month of focus on breath. So I'd like you to find a place that you won't be disturbed for the remainder of this practice and simply let go of whatever you're doing. Okay, now just begin by taking a breath in through your nose and on the exhale down into relaxation. Then allow your awareness to drop into the space that you are in now as you tune into where you\n"

It's a useful practice to start with just four or five minutes of listening before we begin, and as you progress through this meditation you'll come to remember and accept that listening is always possible. We will start with five minutes. Okay. Five. I'll show you a moment. It will be just slightly before we move into the background. I'll give you some space to really just relax and let go.

There is something which is bothering you and we are discussing about the topic. And I wanted to read something which says - When people get married in one day what does the behaviour evolve when people get married - a boy will behave differently towards his father, a girl will behave in a different manner. Then he will have problems with his parents and become very unkind and arrogant. They should complain about him and complain about their behaviour and their family unit. And it is happening in a family unit at that time the behaviour will be different. The question is whether that one day will happen or the next one.

Feel your entire body sinking down into the chair. Let your entire body relax. Feel the softness of your body. Your breathing is so easy, you can only hear me. Now let's bring awareness to your spine. Imagine you're walking through a forest, standing in beautiful ferns, this vast part of the forest is protected by a strong, strong, and strong tree. In order to get out of this tree, you need to ensure that there are two legs. The first is the green, and it's the longest it survives. The second is the deep, green, and it's very strong, covering you from the ground. Notice the animal in the center of each toe. The creature looks familiar and you can almost taste its solid color. Now tune into your body, the way it feels. Your toes, the soles of your feet, how long it's in its body. You can almost feel the whole thing. If you can't, then you won't like it, not quite prepared for it. But listen closely and the process of this meditation changes everything. Every new muscle in your body is meeting now with an attitude of gratitude. There is\n",

As you relax focus on any sensations in your body, and also if you're yawning, focus on the sound of my voice and through my breath. As you watch, visualize and feel your muscles getting heavier and more relaxed. Take a moment for gratitude for this gift, and slowly release all the tension that may be stored within your body. You can close your eyes if you feel comfortable. This is time for you, to take deep cleansing breaths to let go of all stress and tension that you've placed upon yourself. This is your time to sleep deeply, for awakening new energy, and vitality. Take a few slow deep breaths here and let your muscles relax. Let any tension or tightness you've been storing away begin to dissolving. Fully, let go of your day thus far. This meditation is called restful sleep and it will help you to reclaim your old tired, fearful energy. This is time for you to see the good in everything and to reclaim your trust in the body and the mind of the soul. By letting go of the past and worrying about tomorrow, you can cleanse the negative energy that is stored within the body. Notice that your body feels lighter and heavier. With your eyes closed try to focus your attention inward. Feeling lighter, your mind relaxing. Focus your attention inside, and\n",

We'll be doing this sitting position before we move into a more dynamic and relaxing breath. There are four parts to this meditation. One is with awareness. Keeping the shoulders relaxed will keep you from falling asleep and the other part is with an awareness through our breath. Become aware of how the breath feels in your body. Tune in to your body's natural breath pattern and how it feels from head to toe, letting your body know it's time to relax. You might want to close your eyes and place your hands just above the bellybutton and breathe into this area. You might want to allow your belly to rise, or fall gently. As you breathe, feel the air flowing gently through your nostrils. All the air exiting the body through the power of breath through the power of awareness. Once you've done this, allow your breath to normalize. The next breath we'll be doing is an alternate nostril breathing technique. alternate nostril breathing is a common breathing technique that we all use at different times throughout our lives. When you're inhaling air in to your belly through the nose and then exhaling air through your mouth. In contrast, when you're inhaling air through your upper back, let the air release. If you want to create a larger capacity as you breathe in to fill up your abdomen, lower back or chest. That way\n",
