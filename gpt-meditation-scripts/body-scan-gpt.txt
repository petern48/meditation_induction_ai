Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down. Gently close your eyes and take a moment to settle into a relaxed position. Allow your body to soften and release any tension.

[Breath Awareness]

Begin by bringing your attention to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your breath as it flows in and out of your body. With each breath, imagine a wave of relaxation washing over you, soothing and calming your entire being.

[Feet and Toes]

Shift your attention to your feet and toes. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently tighten the muscles in your feet by curling your toes. Hold the tension for a moment, and then slowly release the tension as you exhale, allowing your feet to completely relax. Feel the sensation of relaxation spreading through your feet and toes.

[Lower Legs and Calves]

Move your attention to your lower legs and calves. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, tighten the muscles in your calves by pointing your toes toward your knees. Hold the tension for a moment, and then gradually release the tension as you exhale, allowing your lower legs to fully relax. Feel the tension dissolving, replaced by a deep sense of relaxation.

[Knees and Thighs]

Bring your focus to your knees and thighs. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently tighten the muscles in your thighs by pressing your knees together. Hold the tension briefly, and then slowly release the tension as you exhale, allowing your knees and thighs to soften and relax. Feel the heaviness and relaxation spreading through your legs.

[Hips and Pelvis]

Shift your attention to your hips and pelvis. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, gently tighten the muscles in your hips and glutes by squeezing them together. Hold the tension for a moment, and then gradually release the tension as you exhale, allowing your hips and pelvis to completely relax. Feel any residual stress or tension melting away.

[Abdomen and Chest]

Move your focus to your abdomen and chest. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently tighten the muscles in your abdomen by drawing your belly button toward your spine. Hold the tension for a moment, and then slowly release the tension as you exhale, allowing your abdomen and chest to soften and relax. Feel a sense of calm and tranquility spreading through your core.

[Shoulders and Arms]

Bring your attention to your shoulders and arms. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, gently lift your shoulders up towards your ears, creating tension in the muscles. Hold the tension briefly, and then gradually release the tension as you exhale, allowing your shoulders to drop and your arms to relax by your sides. Feel any tightness or stress melting away, replaced by a deep sense of relaxation.

[Hands and Fingers]

Shift your focus to your hands and fingers. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, tightly clench your fists, creating tension in your hands and fingers. Hold the tension briefly, and then slowly release the tension as you exhale, allowing your hands and fingers to gently unfurl and relax. Feel a soothing wave of relaxation flowing through your hands.

[Neck and Jaw]

Now, bring your attention to your neck and jaw. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, gently tighten the muscles in your neck and jaw by clenching your jaw or bringing your shoulders closer to your ears. Hold the tension briefly, and then gradually release the tension as you exhale, allowing your neck and jaw to soften and relax. Feel any lingering tension or tightness dissolving.

[Face and Head]

Finally, bring your attention to your face and head. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, gently scrunch your face, wrinkling your forehead and squeezing your eyes shut. Hold the tension briefly, and then slowly release the tension as you exhale, allowing your face and head to relax completely. Feel a sense of serenity and calm spreading throughout your entire being.

[Full Body Awareness]

Take a moment to bring your attention to your entire body. Feel the sensations of relaxation and lightness flowing through each part of your body. Enjoy the deep state of relaxation you have cultivated through the tension and release exercises.
