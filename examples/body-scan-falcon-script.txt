1. Begin in a comfortable position, sitting upright with your back straight and your feet flat on the floor. Take three deep, slow breaths. 
2. Bring your attention to your feet and take a few moments to feel the weight and pressure in each of your toes, one at a time. Hold the tension for a few seconds and then release, allowing each toe to relax. 
3. Focus your attention on your calves, starting from your ankles and working up to your thighs. Tense your calf muscles, then let the tension go as you exhale. 
4. Now bring your attention to your neck, beginning at the base of your skull, where the neck muscles connect to the skull. Tense the muscles of your neck, inhaling deeply as you do. Release the tension, exhaling as you go down the neck, from the skull to the tailbone. 
5. Move up to your shoulders. Tense the muscles around your shoulder blades, inhaling deeply as you do. Let go of the tension, exhaling as you come down the shoulders to release any remaining tension. 
6. Slowly bring your attention to your arms, starting at your shoulders and working down to your fingers. Tense the muscles of your forearms, then let the tension go as you exhale. 
7. Now, focusing on your shoulders, tense the upper back muscles, starting from the base of your skull and working up to the crown. Hold the tension a few moments as you inhale deeply. Exhaling slowly, release the tension and return to your natural breath. 
8. Now bring your attention back to your feet and repeat the cycle, inhaling and exhaling deeply with each muscle group. 
9. As a finishing touch, let your body release completely, starting at your toes and working up to your head. Focus on your breath and allow your body to relax and release.
