Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair. Take a few deep breaths and close your eyes.

Begin by bringing your attention to your breath. Feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body. Notice the rise and fall of your chest or your belly as you inhale and exhale.

Now, gradually move your attention to your body. Notice the sensations in your feet, ankles, knees, hips, and lower back. Feel the weight of your body on the ground or in your chair.

As you continue to breathe deeply, begin to move your body. Take a slow and deliberate walk around the room, noticing the sensation of your feet touching the ground with each step. Pay attention to the movement of your legs, hips, and torso as you walk.

As you walk, bring your attention to your breath and your body in the present moment. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort in your body and try to release them as you exhale.

Continue walking for a few minutes, gradually increasing your pace and using your breath to guide you. When you feel ready, bring your attention back to your seated position and take a few more deep breaths.

Finally, bring your attention to your senses. Notice the sounds in the room, the sensation of the air on your skin, and the feeling of your seat or the ground beneath you. Take a few moments to observe these sensations with curiosity and openness.

Remember to always keep your breath as the anchor for your attention, using it to guide you through this movement meditation. With each breath, feel yourself becoming more grounded and centered in the present moment.
