"Begin by finding a comfortable position, either lying down or sitting in silence. Allow your body to settle into stillness, letting go of any tension or discomfort. Take a few deep breaths and focus your attention inward.

As you settle into this state of stillness, bring your attention to your breath. Observe the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body, without trying to control or change it. Allow your breath to become the anchor for your meditation practice.

As you continue to observe your breath, begin to widen your attention to include the sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort and allow them to release. Allow your body to become heavy and relaxed, like a stone sinking into the depths of a river.

Now bring your attention to your thoughts and emotions. Observe them without judgment or attachment. Notice how they arise and pass away, like waves on the surface of a lake. Allow yourself to be present with these thoughts and emotions, without getting caught up in them.

As you continue to practice this meditation, allow yourself to become more and more aware of your inner experience. Observe the subtleties of your thoughts and emotions, the way they shift and change like the wind in a field of grass.

And as you come to the end of your meditation, take a moment to notice how you feel. Notice any changes in your body or mind, any sense of relaxation or clarity. And when you are ready, slowly open your eyes and return to your day with a sense of calm and inner peace.
