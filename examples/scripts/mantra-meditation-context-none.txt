Inhale for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts.

Repeat the following phrase to yourself:
"Om mani padme hum"

(silence for a brief moment)

Repeat the phrase again:
"Om mani padme hum"

(silence for a brief moment)

Repeat the phrase once more:
"Om mani padme hum"

Continue repeating the phrase for as long as you like, or for a set time of 10-20 minutes.

You can also experiment with different mantras, such as "Om shanti shanti shanti" or "I am peace, I am calm, I am worthy." Find a phrase that resonates with you and feels comfortable to repeat.

As you repeat the mantra, try to focus on the sounds and words, and let go of any thoughts or distractions that come up. Allow the mantra to become a anchor for your meditation practice, and a reminder of your intention to cultivate peace and calm in your daily life.

Remember, the goal of mantra meditation is not to force your mind to be quiet, but to allow it to settle and focus on the repetitive sound or phrase. With consistent practice, you may find that the mantra becomes a source of comfort and inner peace, helping you to feel more grounded and centered in your daily life.
