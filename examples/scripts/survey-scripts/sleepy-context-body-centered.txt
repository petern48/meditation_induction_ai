Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale out through your mouth. Allow your body to relax and sink into the comfort of your bed.

Notice the sensation of your body lying on the bed, the feeling of the sheets and blankets underneath you. Feel the weight of your body on the mattress, and the support of the bed beneath you.

As you inhale, imagine light and relaxation entering your body through your breath. Allow your muscles to release any tension or stress, and feel your body growing heavier and more relaxed with each breath.

As you exhale, imagine any stress or tension leaving your body, along with any thoughts or worries that may be weighing you down. Allow yourself to let go of any thoughts or emotions that may be causing you distress, and simply focus on the sensation of your body in the present moment.

Now, bring your attention to each part of your body, starting at the crown of your head and working your way down to your toes. As you focus on each area, imagine any tension or discomfort melting away, replaced by a feeling of calm and relaxation.

Notice the sensation of your heart beating in your chest, the warmth of your skin, and the sensation of the air on your skin. Allow yourself to fully relax and let go, trusting that your body will take care of itself as you drift off to sleep.

As you begin to fall asleep, imagine a wave of relaxation washing over you, carrying you peacefully into a state of deep relaxation and sleep. Allow yourself to fully let go and surrender to sleep, feeling refreshed and rejuvenated after a long day of school.

Take one last deep breath, and allow yourself to drift off into a peaceful slumber, surrounded by the warmth and comfort of your bed. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.
