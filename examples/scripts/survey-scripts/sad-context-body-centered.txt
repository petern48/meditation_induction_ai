Begin by tensing your toes, curl them under and then release. Feel the weight of your body sink into the ground. Notice how your toes connect to your feet, and how your feet connect to your ankles, calves, and thighs. As you exhale, release the tension in your toes and allow your feet to relax.

Take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale out through your mouth. Feel your body sinking into the ground, like roots growing deeper into the soil. Visualize any tension or stress leaving your body, with each exhale.

Focus your attention on your heart center, and visualize a warm, comforting light filling it up with warmth. This light represents love and connection you shared with the person you lost, and it's still present within you, even though they're not physically here. Feel any sadness or grief floating away from this light, carried on the outbreath.

Now, bring your attention to your belly. Imagine a wave of soothing, calming energy flowing into your abdomen, like a gentle ocean breeze. Allow yourself to feel this sensation deeply, and allow your body to relax even further.

Take a few more deep breaths, imagine it leaving your body, like a cloud floating away into the sky. Imagine any tension or discomfort leaving your legs and traveling up your body.

Remember, it's okay to feel sad, and it's important to give yourself time to process your emotions. But also, know that you're not alone, your lost one will always be with you in spirit and there are people and resources available to help you through this challenging time.

Take a few more deep breaths, and when you're ready, slowly open your eyes, and remember that you're loved and supported.
