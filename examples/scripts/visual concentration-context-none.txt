Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down, close your eyes, and begin to focus your attention on a visual object of your choice, such as a candle flame, a visualization of a peaceful landscape, or a mantra.

As you breathe in, visualize a bright, pulsing light at the center of your forehead. This light represents your center of awareness, and it is growing larger and more intense with each breath.

As you focus on the visual object, bring your attention to the sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and imagine a wave of relaxation spreading through those areas as you exhale.

Visualize the light at the center of your forehead growing even brighter and more vibrant, and imagine it filling your entire body with a sense of calm and well-being.

As you continue to concentrate on the visual object, bring your attention to any thoughts or emotions that may arise. Observe them with a sense of curiosity and detachment, without judgment or attachment.

As you maintain your concentration, imagine a sense of calm and clarity growing within you, like a peaceful lake or a serene mountain range.

Continue to focus on the visual object and the sensations in your body, and allow yourself to settle into a deeper and more centered state of mind. With each breath, feel yourself becoming more and more present and aware in the moment.

Remember, the goal of this meditation is not to control your thoughts or emotions, but to simply observe them with a sense of curiosity and detachment. As you practice, you will find that your ability to concentrate and focus will increase, and you will be better able to navigate life's challenges with greater clarity and peace of mind.
