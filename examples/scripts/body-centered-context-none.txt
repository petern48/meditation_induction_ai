Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Bring your attention to your body, starting from the crown of your head.

As you exhale, feel any tension or stress leaving your body, allowing your body to relax and release.

Now, focus your attention on your breath. Feel the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils, the rise and fall of your chest or belly, the gentle flutter of your throat. Try to maintain a steady, calm breathing rhythm.

As you continue to breathe, begin to bring your attention to different parts of your body. Start at the crown of your head and scan down to the tip of your nose, noticing any sensations or sensations of warmth or coolness.

Then, move your attention to your face, noticing the shape of your eyes, the curve of your lips, the sensation of your skin.

Next, bring your attention to your throat, noticing the rise and fall of your breath, any sensations of tension or relaxation.

Continue this process, scanning your body from the crown of your head to your toes, noticing any areas of tension or relaxation, any sensations of warmth or coolness.

As you focus on each area, allow yourself to release any tension or stress, allowing your body to relax and release.

Now, bring your attention to your belly button, and imagine a bright, warm light emanating from this center. As you inhale, imagine this light expanding throughout your body, filling you with warmth and relaxation.

As you exhale, imagine any tension or stress leaving your body, carried away by the light.
