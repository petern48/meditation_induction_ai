Find a comfortable seated position, with your back straight and your body relaxed. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. As you inhale, visualize fresh, clean air entering your body, and as you exhale, visualize any stress or tension leaving your body.

Begin by cultivating compassion for yourself and others. Silently repeat the following phrases to yourself, allowing each word to sink in deeply:

May I be free from suffering and happiness.
May I be happy and free from suffering.
May I be filled with compassion and loving-kindness.
May I be peaceful and free from suffering.

Next, shift your attention to loving-kindness. Silently repeat the following phrases to yourself, allowing each word to sink in deeply:

May I be kind and compassionate towards myself and others.
May I be filled with love and kindness towards myself and others.
May I be happy and peaceful, and may my happiness and peace extend to others.
May I be a source of love and kindness for myself and others.

Now, cultivate equanimity. Silently repeat the following phrases to yourself, allowing each word to sink in deeply:

May I be calm and peaceful, no matter what arises.
May I be free from attachment and aversion.
May I be balanced and equanimous, with a sense of inner peace and clarity.
May I be a refuge for myself and others, providing a place of safety and security.

As you continue to breathe deeply and slowly, allow these phrases to become a part of your inner dialogue. Repeat them to yourself whenever you feel stressed or anxious, and allow them to cultivate a sense of calm and well-being within you.
