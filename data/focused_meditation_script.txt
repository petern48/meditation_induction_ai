Begin by finding a comfortable seated position and focusing on your breath. As you inhale, take in the fresh air and as you exhale, release any tension in your body. Now, using your sight, take in your surroundings and notice the colors, shapes, and textures of your environment. As you focus on each of your senses, gently bring your attention back to your breath. Finally, allow your mind to wander and let thoughts come and go, but always gently bring your focus back to your breath.
